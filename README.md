# Sentiment-Analysis
The aim of this project is to develop a operational classifier for accurate and automatic sentiment classification of a known tweet data set. In the past decade, new forms of communication, such as microblogging and text messaging have emerged and become ubiquitous.  Python sentiment analysis is a methodology for analyzing a piece of text to discover the sentiment hidden within it. It accomplishes this by combining machine learning and natural language processing (NLP). Sentiment analysis allows us to examine the feelings expressed in a piece of text. While there is no limit to the range of information conveyed by tweets and texts, often these short messages are used to share opinions and sentiments that people have about what is going on in the world around them. We have worked on the following task, the task is: Given a tweet, classify whether the tweet is of positive, negative, or neutral sentiment.
